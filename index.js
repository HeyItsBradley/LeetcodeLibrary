//Two Sum EASY

//How it works: loops one time to stay on the current number i, then loops again to compare the other numbers in the array against it, being x. If there is a pair where x + i === the target, and they are not the same index, then create a variable called answer, containing an array of i and x, and returns it.
var twoSum = function (nums, target) {
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let x = 0; x < nums.length; x++) {
      if (nums[i] + nums[x] === target && i != x) {
        let answer = [i, x];
        console.log(answer);
        return answer;
      }
    }
  }
};

twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9);
